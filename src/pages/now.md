## 📝 Writing

I finished my [2022 Year in Review](/2022)!

I say this every year, but I want 2023 to be a year of creating more. My energy is highest when reading, writing, and sharing ideas, and I've gotten away from all of those habits.

The classic "blog" is a refined chronological feed, but I'm starting to think of my posts as one big batch of "notes". Some standard polished articles, some rough ideas that I plan to edit, some book reviews, who knows. Probably bad for SEO, but more reflective of me—and less pressure. Nobody really cares anyway.

## 📚 Reading

I just purchased Tiago Forte's [Building A Second Brain](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Second-Brain-Organize-Potential/dp/1982167386). Recently, I'm fascinated by the concept of note-taking for learning, memory, and creative thinking. I'll post some book notes somewhere when I finish it 😉

Oh, and I'm also finally reading [Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555) in a "book club" with two friends. We're taking our time and will finish in March.

## 👨‍💻 Work

We finally have a working Storybook with the roughest custom element you've ever seen. Getting [v7-beta](https://storybook.js.org/blog/7-0-beta/) to work with the builder, HTML/web components framework, and the proper addons has been no small task.

## 📷 Hobbies

I added a [drone](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1700260-REG/dji_cp_ma_00000492_02_mini_3_pro_with.html) to my video gear to add variety to [Anna's music](https://www.youtube.com/@annapalfreeman)—and other—videos.

~~I hope to practice flying it soon.~~ Still haven't gotten out!
