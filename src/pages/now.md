## 📝 Writing

2022 Year in Review blog post coming soon!

## 📚 Reading

I just finished [Four Thousand Weeks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks), quite possibly my favorite productivity/self-improvement book of all time.

## 👨‍💻 Work

Our team at Microsoft is investigating a rewrite of our design system using [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). Lots to learn, but shipping encapsulated components should result in better UI consistency and adoption across platforms.

## 📷 Hobbies

I added a [drone](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1700260-REG/dji_cp_ma_00000492_02_mini_3_pro_with.html) to my video gear to add variety to [Anna's music](https://www.youtube.com/@annapalfreeman)—and other—videos. I hope to practice flying it soon.
