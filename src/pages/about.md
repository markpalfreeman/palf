## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Aside from being a web developer, I'm a husband, dad, drummer, entrepreneur, and [photographer](https://instagram.com/markpalfreeman). In my spare time, I enjoy getting outside in the PNW ðŸŒ², music, soccer, whiskey, and [books](https://www.goodreads.com/markpalfreeman).

I work at [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com) from ~Redmond, WA~ home on a UI engineering team building a design system for marketing and store experiences.

I co-founded the [Seattle Whiskey Collective](https://seattlewhiskeycollective.com), a whiskey tasting community that meets monthly to taste American (and other) whiskey with a fun group of fans.

Authors that inspire me are [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs), [Adam Grant](https://adamgrant.net), [Seth Godin](https://seths.blog), [BrenÃ© Brown](https://brenebrown.com/), [Simon Sinek](https://startwithwhy.com/), [Malcolm Gladwell](https://www.gladwellbooks.com/), [C.S. Lewis](https://cslewis.com), and more.
