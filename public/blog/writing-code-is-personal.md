# Writing Code is (and Always Will Be) Personal

I’ve learned a thing or two after entering the web development industry just a short year ago.

People’s opinions differ... a lot. At work specifically, you start to bump into every kind of person, from gifted to trained, from rich to struggling, from hard-nosed to humble. Some are boisterous, some subdued. Some are out to win it all, and some are happy with a paycheck. Some want to teach, and others look to gain from an advantage.

Everyone comes from somewhere different and has a goal in mind during their time at your company.

## Personal Work

Now you take these varied traits and experiences, and you shove them together in teams to get work done. Something concrete like writing web code just got personal.

Absolutely, any web developer should realize by now that their end product should always have a business goal and user in mind. Not *that* kind of personal. I’m talking about the inter-personal nature of building and creating something.

## Working in Teams

People go to school and spend years learning skills, technologies, and implementation, striving toward better patterns for tomorrow. But at some point these skills need to come in contact with others. How does someone else do it? How will two — or 20 — people work on this at the same time? The creation of Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple are attributed to just one man (respectively), but those companies quickly needed teams, and then teams of teams.

As much as developers today want to silo themselves and do it their own way, the best work is done together.

This is one of the key reasons [pair programming](https://www.airpair.com/pair-programming) is becoming a more adopted practice. Mistakes are caught quickly, knowledge is transferred, best practices are enforced, efficiency increases, and development teams are more united in their thinking.

## Encouraging Personal Work

People learn best in groups because they have others with them to ask the stupid questions, try new things, and fail often. We need this personal connection to thrive. Without it, everything we do is a competition and the pressure will hinder us. Developers, like professional speakers, need a *community* where they can relate, practice, teach, assist, and continually get better.

As Jon Acuff says in his recent book [Do Over](http://doover.me), “Making sure you enjoy work isn’t your company’s job. It’s your job.” The same goes for building good relationships with other developers on your team. It’s humans that foster human relationships, not your company. No vision statement or trendy environment directly changes how people act — it’s still up to us to create it (or not).

We can choose to thrive together and accept each other’s failures instead of separating, looking out for ourselves, growing afraid, or getting bitter.

As web developers, we need our interactions, as much as the work itself, to encourage collaboration. We’ll all be better off.

Let’s learn and develop the web together.

Let’s get personal.
